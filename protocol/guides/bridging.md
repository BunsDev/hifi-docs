1. If you haven't added Polygon in your wallet's network menu, click on "Add Polygon Network".
2. Head over to the Polygon bridge tab, click on the available link for your wallet and sign the signature request.
3. Select the token and the amount you are looking to deposit, click on "Deposit" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

:::tip
If you are using Metamask, make sure to click on "Add < asset > to Metamask in Polygon chain" in the bridge interface. This will allow you to directly see the newly deposited asset in your wallet.

4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 to deposit MATIC on the Polygon network.

After about 15 minutes, the bridging transactions should be complete. This is how you bridge your assets from the Ethereum mainnet over to Polygon. To get your funds back on the Ethereum mainnet, follow the same procedure, but click on "Withdraw" instead of "Deposit" in the bridge interface.
